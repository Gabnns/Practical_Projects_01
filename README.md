<h1> Practical_Projects_01 </h1>

Building projects is a huge part of learning how to code. By building a project, you expand your portfolio and learn how to apply your skills to new situations. These projects will help me practice my skills by building a responsive navigation bar with dropdown menus, a slider, and a landing page with a custom modal.
